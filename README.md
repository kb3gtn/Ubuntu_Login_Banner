Ubuntu_Login_Banner
===================

How to get LightDM to display a login banner with accept/decline before starting the users session.

This code base is design to work on ubuntu 14.04.

This current version uses pyqt5 based dialog to display the login message.

TODO: Write some other banner dialogs in other widgets sets and other languages.
Working on:  QT5 C++ dialog implementation so python stuff isn't need..

Wanted: GTK dialog popup version.
